# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a Credit Card Fraud Detection system leveraging machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions within credit card data while minimizing false positives.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the dataset for model compatibility.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing patterns, correlations, and distributions within the dataset to gain insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizing various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks for fraud detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employing metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing models for better accuracy and efficiency.
- **Deployment**: Potential deployment options and considerations for real-time or batch prediction scenarios.

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available credit card transaction dataset containing anonymized features due to confidentiality. The dataset includes a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transactions, facilitating model training and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (for neural networks), etc.
